""" The Nollagames Noita masterpiece Noita include a very difficult enigm, the eyes enigma

And we will bruteforce like wild animals.

Things taken in consideration to automate the discriminate of results:
    * `letters_frequencies` is here to help to identify gibbrish from text [unimplemented]
    * `digrams_occurrence` (e.g. "th" "rd") is here to help to identify gibbrish from text [unimplemented]
    * We assume the first char is a number, and as it's likely to define the texts order,
        the `plain_alphabet` must include "123456789" as it is.

We're focusing on word E1, W1 and E2 as they start the same way, we decode E1, check if it's
non-sense or not, and if relevant, we decode W1 and E2 to validate.

In order to reduce the number of possible key, we're assuming there is few existing blocks:
  * "ABCDEFGHIJKMNLOPQRSTUVWXYZ" 
  * "abcdefghijkmnlopqrstuvwxyz"
  * "123456789" (c.f. rule above)

As the cipher is a set of 83 abstract symbole, we're defining them as ASCII+32[0:82]
  and only manipulate the `plain_alphabet`

The rest of `plain_alphabet` is filled with null, with the hope that it allow us to
identify some words.

The position of fillers are defined by `mask_filler`
